    <h2>Desciption</h2>
    <p> Ethiopian chicken stew.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>barley flour</li>
        <li>millet flour</li>
        <li>water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start with a mix of white and brown teff flour, then add water and whisk.</li>
        <li>Pour this mixture in a large bowl and cover with a thin kitchen towel or cheesecloth to allow for ventilation.</li>
        <li>Place this in a draft-free place and stir twice over the next 24 hours. </li>
        <li>Watch for bubbles, expansion and a tangy or sour aroma after 24 hours of rest time. </li>
        <li>As soon as you notice these signs, add an additional tablespoon of white teff flour and water and whisk to combine. Cover and allow to rest for a few more hours. If bubbles have formed and the batter has expanded, go ahead and cook now. Otherwise, let the injera batter rest for an additional 12 hours, stirring once. </li>
        <li>Once the mixture has doubled in size, heat an 8-inch crepe pan or skillet over medium heat. Coat with a teaspoon of vegetable oil, and pour about Â½ cup of batter on the pan, making a large round flatbread shape from the outside of the pan to the inside. Cover the pan, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook by steam for 1 to 3 minutes.  Remove the spongy injera from the pan with a spatula, transfer to a plate, and repeat until batter is gone.
