    <h2>Desciption</h2>
    <p> Injera flatbread is an ubiquitous side dish in several African countries, where it's used as a side dish and utensil all at once. Think of it as the Ethiopian and Eritrean answer to Indian naan or Greek pita.

        Made in a large, round, flat shape, this teff-based bread is naturally fermented, gluten-free (hello, all the 21st century baking buzzwords!), and typically calls for 20 minutes or less of hands-on time to prepare. If you aren't sold on injera bread already, you sure will be when you taste this tangy delightâ€”and use it to scoop and sop up every last drop of the dishes you serve it with.
        
        Injera is often used as the base of a meal, over the plate yet under the stews, vegetables, salads, and meats that are complemented by the flatbread. The porous and spongy texture makes it stellar at soaking up the maximum amount of sauces and juices. </p>
